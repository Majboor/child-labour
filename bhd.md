Additionally, ensuring that buttons for navigation are clickable enhances user experience and facilitates easy access to relevant information.

### 2. About Us Page:
The About Us page serves as a vital component of the website, providing visitors with essential information about the clinic and its staff. Retrieving missing content and images from the original website helps maintain consistency and authenticity. By ensuring a consistent design with the overall theme, the About Us page becomes visually appealing and reinforces the clinic's brand identity.

### 3. Our Dentists Section:
Reinstating the Our Dentists section is essential for establishing trust and credibility with potential patients. Providing detailed information about the dentists' qualifications and expertise helps visitors understand the clinic's commitment to excellence in dental care. A visually appealing and easy-to-navigate section enhances user experience and encourages visitors to learn more about the clinic's dental professionals.
